# ABC-Insurance
analyze the dataset that will help to create a model that will predict the cost of medical insurance based on various input features

1.	Import libraries such as Pandas, matplotlib, NumPy, and seaborn and load the insurance dataset
2.	Check the shape of the data along with the data types of the column
3.	Check missing values in the dataset and find the appropriate measures to fill in the missing values
4.	Explore the relationship between the feature and target column using a count plot of categorical columns and a scatter plot of numerical columns
5.	Perform data visualization using plots of feature vs feature
6.	Check if the number of premium charges for smokers or non-smokers is increasing as they are aging
7.	Make linear mode for prediction.
8.	Make scatter plot to analyze the trends for future improvement
9.	Make polynomial regression to improve mode and adding additional column to improve predictability
10.	Make scatter plot to analyze the predicted values.
